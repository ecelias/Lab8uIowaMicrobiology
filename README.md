# Lab8uIowaMicrobiology

This RShiny app was reconfigured from the source code written by Carolyne Huang from Emory University. 

While the original app was more than capable of serving it's purpose, high traffic made it difficult for students at the University of Iowa to use properly. This app will be used by the University of Iowa specifically to reduce site traffic and offer new features such as the ability to save any graphs as a PNG and view multiple taxonomic levels side-by-side rather than one at a time. 

Furthermore, I was unable to determine the version of R used in the original code, which meant I had to manually determine what functions from what packages were depreciated and adjust the code accordingly. The second goal of this project is to provide robust documentation so that if any future issues are identified, it is easier for those without a strong computer science background to update the code as needed.
